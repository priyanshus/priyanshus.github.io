I discovered this issue on one of the most popular matrimonial site under a bug bounty program, where I was able clone the source code without having access to the git repository.

During the initial recon stage, I noticed that `.git/config` file is publicly accessible for that particular website. If application does not deny the access to client side repository then it can lead to an issue where codebase, revisions and sensitive information can be accessed.

POC:
1. I visited to this url: https://vulnerablesite.com/.git/config and noticed it is accessible.
2. I took help of https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools to dump all possible files of .git directory.
3. Using the Extractor available in GitTools, I managed to clone the source code of vulnerablesite.com.
4. Though the cloned codebase was not in usable condition, however I found a goldmine as `config.php`. The `config.php` was having sensitive entry like below:

```
dbhost: somehost
dbusername: dbusername
dbpassword: dbpassword
```

**Unfortunately, this bug was already reported by some other person so I did not get any bounty for this. But, it was a good learning that exposing .git directory can be very risky and it can be exploited easily.**
